        <h3>Hi, my name is <b>Spencer Ashcraft</b>. I love the outdoors, learning, and Captain America. I'm from Salem Utah, but I was raised in Tuscon Arizona. This is my second semester and my major is currently computer science. I think web developement will be good to know just based on the fact of how much I use google. If we're all spending so much time on there it has to be somewhat important

            <h2>Beliefs:</h2>
            <h3>I was raised in the church and have been active for the majority of my life. Once I graduated high school I received a mission call to the Tennesse Nashville Mission. However, after attending the MTC, I switched to a service mission and served at various locations for a year. I am still learning my things about my beliefs, but BYUI has been a wonderful place to do so. My testimony has been strengthened here more than I could explain. I testify of the worth of knowledge in God's eyes and the spirit that presides over this campus.</h3>

        <h2>Fun Stuff:</h2>
        <h3>I love playing pickle-ball, disc golf, and running. Marvel and Star Wars had the best movies but they do struggle more now. Longboarding and dirtbike riding are two of the best things in this life.</h3>
