        <h2>Who is Steve Rogers?</h2>
        <p>Steve Rogers was born,believe it or not, to Joseph and Sarah Rogers July 4, 1922. Both of his parents fought in the military and died while serving their country. This left Rogers to learn how to fend for himself with his best friend James "Bucky" Barnes. When the United States of America entered World War II in 1939, he was one of the first in line to enlist. Due to his health conditions he was denied and forced to watch those around join the fight. He is noticed sometime after by a German scientist who notices his good heart. Rogers volunteers to be part of a super soldier program. This would give an individual enhanced speed, strength, reactions, and more. Essentially making a perfect soldier. Rogers went under a procedure that gave him all the traits of a super soldier and the body of a greek god. Following this he helped the US military battle the Nazis across Europe. One mission ended up costing Rogers his best friend, Bucky, and was thrown into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
