      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Individuals will visit my site to learn more about the hero Captain America and view merch options available across multiple websites. I want to have the first page explaining the story of Captain America in depth. Specifically his origin story, his development into the First Avenger, and his roles in Earths mightiest heroes.
      </p>
      <b>Uniqueness of Website</b>
      <p>
        Visitors will be able to research, join the fan group, or go shopping on my website. The activities are not overly complex ideas, but I want the way they are presented to be more complex to make a very good looking website. I feel like most websites I have seen use simple concepts and then use they are web development skills to make the website work.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far the best website has a lot of features for its audience but is only updated to infinity on their movie profile. The stories seem really long and do not seem to present themselves in a way that is pleasing to the audience. It also does not have a merch section, but it did have more references to the comics. I had want to mainly stick to the MCUs Steve Rogers so that I can cover that part of their website better than they did. This will allow me to better compete with their webpage and be known for different features than theirs.
      </p>
      <b>Questions to Answer</b>
      <ol>
        <li>Who is Captain America?</li>
        <li>What are his powers and how did he gain them?</li>
        <li>What are the Avengers?</li>
        <li>What type of leader is Captain America?</li>
      </ol>

        <img src="images/shiny_shield.png" alt="Shiny Shield">

      </ul>
      <h3>Merch</h3>
      <p>
        The second page will be for selling the merch tied to Captain America. This will have links to eBay, Amazon, Walmart, or any other reliable sites that sell these items. I will have the price, website name, and item name on the page of my website. I want these to be displayed as images and when selected they should bring the user to the website. Each image will have a short description with it.
      </p>
      <b>Display</b>
      <p>
        Other websites dedicated to him seem to just be a lot of text and images. I want to make my page more of an interaction to allow those users to feel more immersed in the experience. People like it when websites look organized, but when they have features that do enjoyable things there is more excitement involved. I plan on making the images have a hover effect and using grid to position them in an organized way.
      </p>
      <b>Questions to Answer</b>
      <ol>
        <li>What are some cool Captain America items?</li>
        <li>Where can someone purchase Captain America Merch?</li>
        <li>What are the prices for Captain America merch?</li>
        <li>What are the cheapest and highest priced Captain America items?</li>
      </ol>

      </ul>
      <h3>Facts and Fan-page</h3>
      <p>
        The third page will have unique facts about Steve Rogers and have space if I think of any other things I want to add to the website. I want this page to cover facts like his middle name being Grant, his birthday being July 4, or even how in Endgame the song played was Whatever It Takes when he sees Peggy in the past. I want this page to either hold information on the fanpage or have this be where individuals can join the fanpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to create a fan group if possible which will be found on the third page. I want users to feel safe so I would most likely require an email, state/country, and first name. An email will allow me to contact them to deliver information. State/country will allow me to keep my own stats on where the fan base is located. First name will allow me to make it more personal, and not like I’m trying to steal information from them.
